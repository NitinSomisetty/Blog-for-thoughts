**Hello Traveller!**
This is going to be a humble haven for my *random adn wandering* thoughts, those that I wish to share.
*Venerable Reverie* - I chose this name because of the illusion and goal to become a venerable person at some point and because most of what I write starts as a *reverie* â€” a drifting thought or passing idea.
***Stay tuned :)***
